# Plugin development

We created templates for all types of plugins on Github to get you started easily:
- [Authentication](#)
- [Authorization](#)
- [Formfield](#)
- [Generic](#)
- [Theme](https://github.com/voyager-admin/theme-boilerplate)
- [Widget](https://github.com/voyager-admin/widget-boilerplate)

{% hint style="info" %}
One package can provide multiple plugins.  
For example, a plugin could provide multiple widgets or even different types of plugins like a theme and widgets.  
All plugins can be enabled/disabled independently. Make sure they don't depend on each other!
