# Media Manager



## Selecting files

You can select multiple files by pressing `Ctrl` while clicking your desired files.

## Downloading files

After selecting your file(s) you can click the Download button in the toolbar.  
If you selected more than one file a ZIP archive will be generated.

## Mime types

You can set which mime-types are shown in the media-manager by adding mimes to the `media.mime-types` setting.  
Read more about this [here](/formfields/media-picker#mime-types).

## Image optimization

By default all images are optimized through [spatie/laravel-image-optimization](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-image-optimizer).  
You can turn this off in the settings.  
Please follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#optimization-tools) on how to install various optimization plugins.

## Thumbnails

You can generate thumbnails by adding settings to a group called "Thumbnails".  
Add a formfield `Dynamic select` and enter `voyager.get-thumbnail-options` as the route in the options.  
Now you can enter the name (which will be the suffix of the filename) and various options, depending on the thumbnail method you choose.

## Watermark

You can automatically add a watermark to each uploaded image.  
To do this, go to `Settings` and select the `Watermark` tab.  
There you can pick an image, set the size, position and opacity of the watermark.  
If you don't want to add watermarks anymore, simply remove the watermark image from the media-picker.
