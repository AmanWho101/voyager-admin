# Media Manager



## Selecting files

You can select multiple files by pressing `Ctrl` while clicking your desired files.

## Mime types

You can set which mime-types are shown in the media-manager by adding mimes to the `media.mime-types` setting.  
Read more about this [here](./bread/formfields/media-picker.md#mime-types).

## Image optimization

By default all images are optimized through [spatie/laravel-image-optimization](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-image-optimizer).  
You can turn this off in the settings.  
Please follow the [official documentation](https://github.com/spatie/image-optimizer#optimization-tools) on how to install various optimization plugins.
