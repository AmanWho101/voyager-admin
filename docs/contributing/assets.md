# Assets

If you changed any javascript or CSS files, do **not** commit you compiled js/css files from the `dist` folder.  
Those will be compiled automatically after your pull request was merged.  
This allows us to have multiple pull request touching assets without conflicting.


If you already included any compiled asset - no problem.  
Just commit the current version from our Github repo.  
This will add an additional commit, but will keep the file untouched.
