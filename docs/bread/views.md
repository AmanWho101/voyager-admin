# Views

Views are used for editing, adding and reading a BREAD entry and relationship entries. 

## Drag & Drop

To move a formfield to another position click and hold `resize` button and dragging your mouse to the position you want your formfield to be.

## Resizing formfields

You can resize a formfield by clicking and holding the `left/right` button and dragging your mouse left/right.

## Tabs

Sometimes a BREAD can contain so many formfields that you want to split them into groups.  
For example, the user BREAD contains information, projects and so on.  

### Add a tab

To add a tab, simply click the `+` button on the very top of the view builder, enter the name and hit `Enter`.

### Remove a tab

Click the trash icon next to your tab to remove it. 
All formfields in this tab will be moved to `No tab`.

### Rename a tab

Simply double click the name of the tab you want to rename and enter the new name.  
Hit enter to save the new name.

### Adding formfields to a tab

When a tab is active (highlighted) you can add formfields thorugh the `Add formfield` dropdown. 
If you want to move a formfield from a tab to another, simply click the layer icon on the formfield and select the tab you want it to move to.

### Not using tabs?

No problem, keep all your formfields in `No tab` and they won't be shown.
