# Layouts

Layouts are used when browsing, reading, editing or adding an entry to your BREAD.  
A BREAD can contain endless layouts and different layouts can then be used for different actions.

There are two kinds of layouts, [lists](lists.md) and [views](views.md).  
Lists are used for browsing a BREAD/relationships and views for editing, adding and reading.

{% hint style="info" %}
With additional plugins, layouts can be mapped to various conditions.  
For example, users use layout X for adding/editing and admins use layout Y.
{% endhint %}
