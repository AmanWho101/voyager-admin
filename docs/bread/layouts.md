# Layouts

Layouts are used when browsing, reading, editing or adding an entry to your BREAD.  
A BREAD can contain endless layouts and different layouts can then be used for different actions.

There are two kinds of layouts, [lists](lists.md) and [views](views.md).  
Lists are used for browsing a BREAD/relationships and views for editing, adding and reading.

{% hint style="info" %}
With additional plugins, layouts can be mapped to various conditions.  
For example, users use layout X for adding/editing and admins use layout Y.
{% endhint %}

## Add a layout

Click the `Add Layout` button and select `View` or `List`.  
Now a dialog will open asking you to enter a name. 

## Rename a layout

Click on the `Actions` button and select `Rename layout`, enter the new name and hit enter (or press `Ok`).

## Clone a layout

To clone a layout with all formfields and settings, click on the `Actions` button and select `Clone layout`.  
This will create a cloned layout named `Name 2`. You can now rename it to whatever you desire.

## Delete a layout

Click on the `Actions` button and select `Delete layout` and confirm that you want to delete this layout. 
Please be aware that all formfields in this layout will be deleted as well!

## Add a formfield to a layout

Click the `Add Formfield` button and select the formfield you want to add.
